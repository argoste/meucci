# Brief history of this project

Written on 2016-05-11

This project is about learning database design, UML, MySQL, PHP.

And maybe make something useful for someone setting up a library.

It started with the name of Meucci as a conceptual model for a library
information system, with an implementation with SQLite.

Then I started making a PHP + MySQL project called Pergamos. To learn how to
connect a PHP website with a MySQL database. I thought I can make a generic
software that could be used for any public Library.

Now,  2016-05-11, I decided to just solve the problem of an hypotetic library
of a small town. The name of the library is "Antonio Meucci" (after the
inventor of the phone). I have to decide for a name for "Meucci Public Library
Information System". It could be somethin from ancient Greece or Rome,
something about a strange machinery, or better about the community of people
that forms the information system, much more important that the machinery
itself. Acropolis, Polis, Pergamini, Papiro, Il Sistema Informativo Meucci (SIM
or SIB).

Maybe it can be useful as an example or even a template to use when setting up a
public Library. Of course it should be modified, according to the particular
situation of each library.
