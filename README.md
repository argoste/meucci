#The Meucci Project

by Stefano Carlesso stefanocarlesso@gmx.com

I'm making an information system for a public library.

For me it is mainly an exercise in database development. I hope it also can be
useful to address some real world problems.

The system is targeted toward an hypotetic library of a small town.

The parts making up the project are in different directories.

+ setup: here you can find instructions and scripts to setup the LAMP server.
+ mysql_code: the scripts that define "database schema" (sql as data definition
language). 
+ website: here you  can find the PHP, HTML, CSS code to deploy on your server.
+ history: brief history of the project. 
+ model2: Analysis and design phases of the database. You find an UML model.
+ classification_system: holds the brainstorming about the classification system
for the books.
