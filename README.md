# The Meucci Project

I'm making an information system for a public library.

For me it is mainly an exercise in database development. I hope it also can be
useful to address some real world problems.

The system is targeted toward an hypotetic library of a small town.

The parts making up the project are in different directories.

+ data_model: Analysis and design phases of the database. You find an UML model. Diagrams are drawn with [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/).
+ src:
  + create_database: mostly SQL code for your Database Server (MariaDB)
  + application: here you  can find the PHP, HTML, CSS code to deploy on your webserver.
+ documentation
  + setup: instructions to setup the LAMP server.
  + discussion of the project phases and choices.
  + history: brief history of the project.
