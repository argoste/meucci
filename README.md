#The Meucci Project

by Stefano Carlesso stefanocarlesso@gmx.com

I'm making an information system for a public library.

For me it is mainly an exercise in database development. I hope it also can be
useful to address some real world problems.

The system is targeted toward an hypotetic library of a small town.

The parts making up the project are in different directories.


+ src: 
  + create_database: mostly SQL code
  + application: here you  can find the PHP, HTML, CSS code to deploy on your webserver.
+ data_model: Analysis and design phases of the database. You find an UML model.
+ documentation will contain the published version of history, the user manual.
  + setup: here you can find instructions and scripts to setup the LAMP server.
  + history: brief history of the project.
